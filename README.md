Pre-requisites
------------------

* JDK 1.8

* Redis 
* ActiveMQ 5.14
* Zookeeper
* Hadoop CDH5
* Tomcat 7
* Docker
* [Fusion charts](http://www.fusioncharts.com/) - This application utilises Fusion charts heavily for all charting needs. 
Fusion charts, however is not open source. You need to purchase the appropriate license from fusion charts, and copy the
files to "modules/api/src/main/webapp/v2/js/fusioncharts-3.11.2.6/" folder and uncomment the script include tags in
"modules/api/src/main/webapp/v2/index.html". Also note that we have begun the work to migrate to nvd3 which is apache 2.0
licensed. So even with out fusion charts graphs and charts will work.
* [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com) - Glyphicons pro version is required to ensure all icons work in the project. Once
 purchased, css should be included in the "modules/api/src/main/webapp/v2/css/3rdparty" and fonts should be included in 
 "modules/api/src/main/webapp/v2/fonts/". Finally, include the following line in index.html
 ```
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/3rdparty/glyphicons-1.9.2.1.css">
 ```
 * [Google maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/pricing-and-plans/) - Google maps is not free when the application is password protected and not freely accessible by the public.
 Before taking this to production purchase the license.
